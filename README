Find files with equal content and make them hard links to one another.

The purpose of this program is to find files that have the same content
and make them hard links to one another, thus saving disk space.

Two files that have the same size, above a specified minimum, and are not
already hard links of a single inode, will be compared byte by byte. 
If they are identical, they have the same owner and permissions and all
links are known for at least one of them, then they can be linked.

This program can also be used to report on all existing hard links within
a directory tree.


Compiling:

  make


Usage:
  linkcheck [ options ] directory ...

  -m    make new links where needed
  -r    report existing links
  -z #  minimum file size (default is 1)


Example:

  linkcheck -m .

to recursively scan all files in the current directory and below, and create
hard links where possible. 


Warning:

This program knows nothing of extended attributes so those may be lost when
hard links are being created.
